## üöÄ **Rapid Development Strategies**

### **AI Pairing Optimization**
- **Parallel Development**: AI handles backend while you work on frontend
- **Code Generation**: Use AI for boilerplate code and repetitive tasks
- **Quick Iterations**: Rapid prototyping with immediate feedback
- **Bug Fixing**: AI assistance for quick problem resolution

### **Time-Saving Techniques**
- **Minimal Viable Features**: Focus on core functionality only
- **Reusable Components**: Build components that can be reused
- **Template-Based Development**: Use existing patterns and templates
- **Skip Non-Essentials**: Defer advanced features to post-MVP

### **Priority Matrix**
```
HIGH PRIORITY (Must Complete):
- Authentication system
- Project management
- Task management
- Basic team features

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have):
- Time tracking
- Basic reporting
- UI polish

LOW PRIORITY (Post-MVP):
- Advanced analytics
- Email notifications
- File uploads
- Advanced permissions
```
